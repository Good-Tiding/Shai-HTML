    <h1>  What is nutrition, and why does it matter?</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Nutrition</b><sup>[1]</sup> is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between <a href="diet.html" target="_blank">diet</a>, health, and disease.<br>

        <em>Nutritionists</em> use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human body.<br>
        
        <u><b>Nutrition</b></u> also focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a nutrient, and how allergies work.<br>
        
        <mark><b>Nutrition</b></mark> provide nourishment. Proteins, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161547" target="_blank">carbohydrates</a>, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients. If people do not have the right balance of nutrients in their diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions increases.
